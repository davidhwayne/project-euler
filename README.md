Project Euler Problems in Python.  

The purpose of these projects is to get practice coding efficient algorithms to solve interesting math problems (mostly number theory). Under the username davidhwayne, I have solved the first 50 of these problems.  Many of them can be solved explicitly using math, those solutions are omitted (more specifically, problems 5,6,9,15,16 have been solved but have been omitted from this repository). This repository contains all of the code used to find the solutions to the problems.  Some of the programs output the answer directly, others also provide additional relevant information.
