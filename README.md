Project Euler Problems in Python.  

The purpose of these projects is to get practice coding efficient algorithms to solve interesting math problems (mostly number theory). Under the username davidhwayne, I have solved the first 50 of these problems.  Many of them can be solved explicitly using math and other tricks, while the others require a more brute force approach which are slower (but will still complete in under a minute). This repository contains all of the code used to find the solutions to the problems.  Each script outputs the answer along with the time it takes to find the answer.
